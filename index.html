      <h1>Lazy loading of images - Img & WebP</h1>
      <h2>Easy and productive library for lazy loading of images</h2>
      <p>Lazy loading of images (<a href="https://wikiour.github.io/lazy-loading-pull">lazy loading</a>) is a web page performance optimization technique that allows images to be
        loaded
        only when they become visible on the user's screen. You can download the <strong>lazy-loading-pull library</strong> from the repository on <a href="https://github.com/wikiour/lazy-loading-pull">GitHub</a> or install it via <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lazy-loading-pull">npm</a>.</p>

      <h2>Lazy loading can provide several benefits</h2>
      <p>* Faster page loading: lazy loading allows images to load only when they become visible on the user's screen.
        This means
        the page loads faster because not all images are loaded at once.
      
        * Save traffic: lazy loading saves traffic because images are loaded only when they're actually needed. This is
        especially useful for users with a mobile internet connection, where traffic restrictions can be strict.
      
        * Improved user experience: lazy loading improves the user experience because users don't have to wait long to
        see page
        content. It can also reduce user bounce because pages load faster and users get the information they were
        looking for
        faster.
      
        * SEO optimization: lazy loading can help in SEO optimization because fast user experience is one of the search
        engine
        ranking factors.</p>

      <div class="container-img-picture">
        <picture>
          <source srcset="./img/image.webp" type="image/webp" />
          <img src="./img/image.png" alt="Images">
        </picture>
      </div>

      <p>Lazy loading can be useful for pages with lots of images, such as galleries, blogs and online stores, which can
        significantly slow down the page loading time. lazy loading of images can speed up page loading, reduce traffic
        usage,
        and improve user experience.</p>

      <p>You can use our "<a href="https://wikiour.github.io/lazy-loading-pull">lazy-loading-pull</a>" JavaScript library to implement lazy image loading. This library uses the
        "data-src"
        attribute instead of "src" for images to be lazily loaded. When the user scrolls the page and the image becomes
        visible,
        JavaScript loads the image from "data-src" to "src." Our library works with any image.</p>

      <p>We also use the "loading" attribute with a value of "lazy," which is supported by browsers starting with Chrome
        76,
        Firefox 75, and Opera 63. This attribute indicates that the browser should lazily load the image when it appears
        in the
        scope.</p>


      <p>In order to lazily load images, our "<a href="https://wikiour.github.io/lazy-loading-pull">lazy-loading-pull</a>" library uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API">Intersection Observer API</a>, which
        detects when
        an item appears on the screen and is ready to be loaded. This API allows you to load images only when they are
        in the
        user's field of view. We also apply a pre-loading of the image before the user reaches it for 1000px (you can
        change
        this parameter in rootMargin: '1000px', ) this avoids waiting for the user to load.
      </p>

      <p>The Intersection Observer API is a JavaScript interface that allows you to monitor the intersection of elements
        on a
        page with other elements or scopes, such as the browser window.</p>

      <p>The Intersection Observer API is used to detect when an element appears on or leaves the screen to perform
        certain
        actions, such as lazily loading images. Instead of loading all images at once, we use the Intersection Observer
        API to
        determine when an image becomes visible on the screen and only then start loading it. This can speed up page
        loading and
        reduce the amount of data transferred.</p>

      <p>The IntersectionObserverEntry object contains information about the intersection state, such as the size and
        coordinates
        of the element, its relationship to another element or scope, and the time when the intersection occurred.</p>

      <p>Overall, the Intersection Observer API can be a very useful tool for improving performance and user experience
        on
        websites.</p>
